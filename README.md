# Embedded-C-project
An embedded system project that aimed at using the concepts of solid angle to track the movement of the sun for the adjustment of solar panel so as to receive a maximum amount of solar energy. This was achieved through using light sensors that are able to detect the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar panel. The project has successfully demonstrated that if such a technology has been implemented, it would increase the efficiency of the solar panels by 23.4%.
